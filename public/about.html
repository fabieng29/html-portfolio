  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Fabien Gauchard and I am a web developer based in London. I have always been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to solve complex problems. That's why I decided to pursue a career in web development.
    I have honed my skills in programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also experienced in using frameworks and libraries such as React and jQuery. You can view some of my projects on my portfolio or GitHub repository.
    </p>
  
  <p>When it comes to web development, I believe in taking a creative approach to problem-solving. I love to think outside the box and come up with unique solutions that meet my clients' needs. I am also a detail-oriented person and strive for excellence in everything I do.
    My goal as a web developer is to work on projects that make a positive impact on people's lives. I am particularly interested in collaborating with clients who share my values and are passionate about creating meaningful solutions.
    </p>
  
  <p>Outside of web development, I enjoy travelling, cooking and meditating. I believe that having a well-rounded life is important for staying motivated and inspired.
    If you are interested in working with me or have any questions, please feel free to get in touch. I would love to hear from you!.
